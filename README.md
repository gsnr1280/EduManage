# PHP Student Portal


PHP Student Portal repository, developed by me and my team. This web application is designed to help students manage their academic and extracurricular activities conveniently. It features several modules, including a login page, timetable page, lost and found page, assignments organizer page, password changing page, and an internship updates page.

## Features

### Login Page

The login page allows students to securely log in to the portal using their credentials. It ensures that only authorized users can access the portal's features.

### Timetable Page

The timetable page provides students with an interface to view their class schedules.

### Lost and Found Page

The lost and found page allows students to post and view lost and found items on campus.

### Assignments Organizer Page

The assignments organizer page helps students manage their assignments, deadlines, and submission status. It provides a centralized location for tracking academic tasks.

### Password Changing Page

Students can change their passwords using the password changing page. This ensures security and privacy for the users.

### Internship Updates Page

The internship updates page keeps students informed about the latest internship opportunities and updates from the career center.
